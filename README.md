# Angular Ionic Demo
A demo project to learn about integrating the Angular framework with the Ionic framework and hosting service.

Designed using Ionic's template for creating an Angular (Standalone) Tabs application.

Current version contains three demonstrations:
- A form that requests and modifies an input before displaying it to the user.
- A table of JSON data that can be sorted using mulitple columns.
- A series of buttons that dynamically modify the CSS of an example text.

Demonstrations are separated using the tabs at the bottom of the application.
